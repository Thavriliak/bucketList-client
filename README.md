Team Project - Bucket List - Front End

Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

Document your planning, process and problem-solving strategy

Our planning process was to create detailed wireframes and user stories. We originally thought we had to include images and connect tot AWS but we were not. After that realization, we focused on getting our Auth connections and our CRUD actions to work and speak to each other. Our strecth goal would be to add pictures for each bucket item. We also implemented a map within our website and another stretch goal is to add markers on the map and connect them with the database/bucket items as well. Once we had the routes/connections established, we focused on styling (which we had a LOT fo fun with.) Our problem solving strategy was to research, look inside the issue queue, ask within the issue queue and brainstorm as a team/peer program.
